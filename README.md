# Add To Cart app

## Description
A great help when shopping at the grocery store. Plan your shopping at home by adding items to the list. Then to remove from the list, click each item when you put it in the shopping cart.

This is a web application but can easily be configured to act as a mobile app on your Android or iPhone by "Add to Home Screen" (see screenshot below). 

NOTE! In the real app which we use in our family the items are stored in a firebase database for common access between our family members. But in this demo version the items are instead stored in the local storage in your browser. This is done to prevent all people in the world to mess with our family's shopping list :-)
